ROS 2 Clips-Executive
======================
The |CX| offers an integration for CLIPS with the ROS ecosystem for developing knowledge-based applications.

CLIPS
+++++
`CLIPS`_ (C Language Integrated Production System) is a rule-based programming language designed for building expert systems. It was developed in the 1980s by NASA to provide a portable, efficient, and easy-to-use environment for developing knowledge-based applications.
CLIPS uses a production rule system, where knowledge is represented as if-then rules. These rules operate on facts, which represent data or conditions in the system. The inference engine (based on the `Rete algorithm`_) matches rules against facts and executes the applicable rules based on a conflict resolution strategy.
Once no rules can be activated anymore, the execution is halted.

The documentation assumes a basic understanding of CLIPS. If you have never worked with CLIPS before, check out the documentation at `clipsrules.net <https://clipsrules.net/>`_ to get familiar with its functionalities.

The :docsite:`clips_vendor` package provides a packaged version of CLIPS suitable for the ROS ecosystem (and is also used by the CLIPS-Executive).

Overview
++++++++

The heart of the |CX| is the CLIPS Environment Manager node of the :docsite:`cx_clips_env_manager` package that allows creating and destroying CLIPS environments and extending these environments through dynamically loadable plugins (e.g., to inject C++ functions).

Several plugins are provided out-of-the-box that enable interfacing with ROS as well as other useful features. See the :ref:`plugins` page for more information.

Package Index
-------------

The **cx_bringup** package provides example configurations of the CLIPS-Executive that serve as a good starting point for familiarization with the system.

To further customize CLIPS, refer to the **cx_clips_env_manager** documentation for more details on plugin handling. You may also review **cx_example_plugin** as a template for writing custom plugins.



Related Projects
----------------

This project is inspired by the original CLIPS-Executive from the `Fawkes robotics framework <https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/3544/3412>`_ (`GitHub <https://github.com/fawkesrobotics/fawkes>`_), which is no longer actively being developed and will be archived soon (once a full transition to ROS is made).

However, while the original CLIPS-Executive presents itself as a goal reasoning framework, this project focuses on generalized CLIPS usage foremost.

It is mostly rewritten from scratch, including a different design philosophy, direct CLIPS 6.4 support via the clips_vendor provider (instead of relying on `clipsmm`_), a more robust CLIPS extension management and new CLIPS existensions.

All new code is released under Apache 2.0 license, while some optional modules that were derived from fawkes are licensed under the GPLv2+ license.
